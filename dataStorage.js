So it's very important that this function is only created once because the goal of this function is not to reuse code by running it multiple times, the only purpose of this function is to create a new scope and return data just once`,

So the module pattern that we just learned about does indeed work quite good but it has some limitations and that's exactly the reason why native modules were added to the language in ES6`,
