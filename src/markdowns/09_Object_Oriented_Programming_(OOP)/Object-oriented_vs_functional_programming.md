Functional vs object-oriented, it all depends on the problem you have. There are times when object-oriented programming might be better. You're building a fairy tale game and you have clear objects characters in the game that have some sort of state and that can interact with that state, and others can interact with them as well. Or you have something like an Amazon shopping cart where there's a clear data that needs to get processed.
