# Introduction to Functional Programming

What is functional programming? Functional programming is all about separation of concerns, which object-oriented programming does as well. Functional programming is all about packaging our code into separate chunks so that everything is well organized.

We see in object-oriented programming how classes are used to store related data (properties) and methods into single object. Functional programming has the idea as well of separating concerns, but  it separates data and functions. A functional programmer views the world as data, and then this data gets interacted with, but we're not going to combine data and functions as one piece or one object.

Most functional programming languages don't have these concepts of classes and methods that belong to objects. Instead, ==functions operate on well defined data structures (like arrays and objects), rather than actually belonging to that data structure, like belonging to an object==.

When it comes to functional programming we have a very important pillar, unlike object-oriented programming where we have four pillars of encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism and inheritance. If you want to break things down in functional programming, it all comes down to a concept called ==**pure functions**==.

==The idea in functional programming is that there is a **separation between data of a program and the behavior of a program**, and **all objects created in functional programming are immutable**==. But what that means is once something is created, it cannot be changed.
