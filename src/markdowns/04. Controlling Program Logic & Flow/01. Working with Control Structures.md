# Working with Control Structures

What does control structures mean?

It means that when you're writing code, **you don't always want to execute exactly the same code top to bottom**. Sometimes you have some condition that should be met for some code to be executed and execute some other code if the condition is not met.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions. You can use conditional statements in your code to do this. In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

- Use `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use `else` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use `else if` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use `switch` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
