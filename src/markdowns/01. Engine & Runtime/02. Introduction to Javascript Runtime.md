# Introduction to Javascript Runtime

Javascript is a **single threaded language**. This means it has one Call Stack and one Memory Heap. As expected, it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before moving onto the next.

**The heart of any JavaScript Runtime is always a JavaScript Engine. Without an engine there is no runtime and there is no JavaScript at all**.

However, **_the engine alone is not enough_. In order to work properly, we also need access to the web APIs (ex. DOM, Timers, Fetch API etc)**.

So essentially **web APIs are functionalities provided to the engine, but which are actually not part of the JavaScript language itself**. _JavaScript simply gets access to these APIs through the global `window` object_.

A typical JavaScript runtime also includes a so called **callback queue. This is a data structure that contains all the callback functions that are ready to be executed**. For example we attach event handler functions to DOM elements like a button to react to certain events, and these event handler functions are also called callback functions. So as the event happens, for example a click, the callback function will be called. And here is how that actually works behind the scenes: so the first thing that actually happens after the event is that the callback function is put into the callback queue. Then when the stack is empty the callback function is passed to the call stack so that it can be executed (this happens by something called the **event loop**). **_So basically the event loop takes callback functions from the callback queue and puts them in the call stack so that they can be executed. The event loop only runs once the call stack is empty and the entire Javascript file has been run once_**.

JavaScript is a single threaded language that can be non blocking. It has one Call Stack and it does one thing at a time. In order to not block the single thread, it can be **_asynchronous with callback functions_** _and these callback functions gets run in the background through the Callback queue and then the Event Loop bring it back into the Call Stack_.

## Event Loop & Callback Queue

When you run some JavaScript code in a browser, the **engine starts to parse the code**. **Each line is executed and popped on and off the call stack**. But, what about Web API's? Web API's are not something JavaScript recognizes, so the parser knows to pass it off to the browser for it to handle. When the browser has finished running its method, it puts what is needed to be ran by JavaScript into the **callback queue**. **The callback queue cannot be ran until the call stack is completely empty**. So, the **event loop** is constantly checking the call stack to see if it is empty so that it can add anything in the callback queue back into the call stack. And finally, once it is back in the call stack, it is ran and then popped off the stack.

```js
console.log('1'); // goes on call stack and runs 1

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('2'), 1000;
});
// gets sent to web api
// web api waits 1 sec, runs and sends to callback queue
// the javascript engine keeps going

console.log('3');
// goes on call stack and runs 3
// event loop keeps checking and see call stack is empty
// event loop sends calback queue into call stack
// 2 is now ran

// 1
// 3
// 2

// Example with 0 second timeout
console.log('1');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('2'), 0;
});

console.log('3');

// 1
// 3
// 2

// Still has the same output
```

In the last example above, we get the same output. How does this work if it waits 0 seconds? The JavaScript engine will still send off the setTimeout() to the Web API to be ran and it will then go into the callback queue and wait until the call stack is empty to be ran. So, we end up with the exact same end point.

> Nifty Snippet: Until 2009, JavaScript was only run inside of the browser. That is when Ryan Dahl decided it would be great if we could use JavaScript to build things outside the browser. He used C and C++ to build an executable (exe) program called Node JS. Node JS is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine that uses C++ to provide the event loop and callback queue needed to run asynchronous operations.

## Job Queue or Microtask Queue

The **job queue** or **microtask queue** came about with promises in ES6. With promises we needed **another callback queue that would give higher priority to promise calls**. The JavaScript engine is going to **check the job queue before the callback queue**.

```js
// 1 Callback Queue ~ Task Queue
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('1', 'is the loneliest number');
}, 0);
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('2', 'can be as bad as one');
}, 10);

// 2 Job Queue ~ Microtask Queue
Promise.resolve('hi').then(data => console.log('2', data));

// 3
console.log('3', 'is a crowd');

// 3 is a crowd
// 2 hi
// undefined Promise resolved
// 1 is the loneliest number
// 2 can be as bad as one
```
