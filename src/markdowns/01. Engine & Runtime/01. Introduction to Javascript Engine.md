# Introduction to Javascript Engine

Javascript Engine is a 'program' that executes JavaScript code. Any JavaScript engine (ex. V8 for Google Chrome) always contains a Call Stack and a Memory Heap. The Call Stack is where our code is actually executed, using something called execution contexts. The Memory Heap is an unstructured memory pool which stores all the objects that our application needs.

Almost everyone that has worked with JavaScript has heard of the **V8 engine, the idea of the JavaScript engine**, and most people know that **JavaScript is a single threaded language** that it uses a **Callback Queue**. You may also hear phrases like **JavaScript is an interpreted language**. What is this engine that we speak of? If I write some code like `const isHappy = true;`, how does the computer read this code?

If I gave a computer with a CPU a file that is a JavaScript file and I tell it "Read this file and do something for me", the computer only understands 1 and 0 at the end of the day, so **the computer doesn't really know what JavaScript is**. So how are we able to communicate using a JavaScript file so that the computer do something for me? And this is the first step in our learning, and that is the JavaScript engine,** by having a JavaScript engine, it allows you to give this engine the JavaScript file and this engine is going to understand the Javascript file and tell the computer what to do**. _In a sense, you just created a translator so you can communicate with somebody that doesn't know your language_, and **this special engine called JavaScript Engine understands JavaScript**. Our computer finally understands us because of this JavaScript engine.

But do you think there's one JavaScript engine or many JavaScript engines? Well, **there are a ton of engines and they're called ECMAScript engines**. So any time we use an engine, we're able to give it a JavaScript file and this JavaScript file gets understood by the engine and it allows this engine to communicate and tell the machine, the computer, to do what we ask it to do with JavaScript.

Now, these engines are written by programmers, for example, **V8 engine is written in C++**, but why do people write these engines? 2008 marked a really pivotal moment in history when it comes to JavaScript because V8 was released by Google. Before then, most browsers used engines that were very basic, which meant that JavaScript was a little bit slow. You see, Google had this problem, they had something called Google Maps and Google Maps, as you know, requires a lot of power, and all the previous engines before V8 would make Google Maps very, very slow on the browser. So with Google Maps and their own Chrome browser, they said, we're going to **write our own JavaScript engine, the V8 engine, so that JavaScript runs way faster** on the browser than it's done previously and in 2008 they released V8.

_But what is inside this engine, this magical machine that understands JavaScript, it reads our code and then it runs this code? Let's get into that in the upcoming lecture, JavaScript Runtime._

So we know that this thing called the JavaScript engine takes our written JavaScript code and does some magic to tell the computer to do what we want it to do. So what's happening inside of this engine, and here's the tricky part, as we know this engine can be built by anybody. Yes, that means you can build your own JavaScript engine, but it's a lot of work and at the end of the day it's just a program. And the V8 engine, which is the most popular, most common, and some would say the fastest JavaScript engine that the Chrome browser and Node.js uses, this engine is written in C++, a low level programming language.

What problem or problems do you see with everybody creating their own engines in JavaScript? Can we just create our own engine and all of a sudden, boom, there it is, we have our JavaScript engine? Well, yes, you can definitely do that, but remember our list on wikipedia, how it was called **ECMAScript engines and not JavaScript engines**. That's because if everybody can just create a JavaScript engine, it'll just be total chaos, which is why ECMAScript was created. It tells people "Hey, here's the standard and how you should do things in JavaScript and how it should work", and **ECMAScript is the governing body of JavaScript that essentially decides how the language should be standardized**, so it tells engine creators "This is how JavaScript should work", but internally, how you build the engine is up to you as long as it conforms to the standards.

A JavaScript engine is a computer program that you give JavaScript code to and it tells the computer how to execute it. Basically a translator for the computer between JavaScript and a language that the computer understands. But what happens inside of the engine? Well, that depends on the engine. There are many JavaScript Engines out there and typically they are created by web browser vendors. All engines are standardized by ECMA Script or ES.

> Nifty Snippet: 2008 was a pivotal moment for JavaScript when Google created the **Chrome V8 Engine**. The V8 engine is an open source high performance JavaScript engine, **written in C++** and **used in the Chrome browser** and **powers Node JS**. The performance outmatched any engine that came before it mainly because it **combines 2 parts of the engine, the interpreter and the compiler**. Today, all major engines use this same technique.

## Interpreter/Compiler/JIT Compiler and Writing Optimized Code

![Image](../../img/Interpreter_Compiler_JIT_Compiler.jpg)

**The Parser**: Parsing is the **process of analyzing the source code**, checking it for errors, and breaking it up into parts.

**The Interpreter**: An interpreter directly **executes each line of code line by line, without requiring them to be compiled into a machine language program**. Interpreters can use different strategies to increase performance. They can parse the source code and execute it immediately, translate it into more efficient machine code, execute precompiled code made by a compiler, or some combination of these. **In the V8 engine, the interpreter outputs bytecode**.

**The Compiler**: The compiler works ahead of time to convert instructions into a machine-code or lowerlevel form so that they can be read and executed by a computer. It **runs all of the code and tries to figure out what the code does and then compiles it down into another language that is easier for the computer to read**.

**The Combo**: In modern engines, the **interpreter starts reading the code line by line** while the **profiler watches for frequently used code and flags then passes is to the compiler to be optimized**. In the end, the JavaScript engine takes the bytecode the interpreter outputs and mixes in the optimized code the compiler outputs and then gives that to the computer. This is called **'Just in Time'** or **JIT Compiler**.

Let's talk about **interpreters** and **compilers**, which, as we can see, are important pieces in our JavaScript engine.

You see, **in programming, there are generally two ways of translating to machine language or something that our computers can understand** and what we're going to talk about here actually applies to most programming languages, not just JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, any language you can think of is going to use some of these concepts, so it's very important.

Let's start with the first one, the interpreter. **With an interpreter, what we do is we _translate and read the files line by line_**.

A **compiler**, unlike an interpreter, **_doesn't translate on the fly_**. What it does is it **_works ahead of time to create a translation of what code we've just written and it compiles down to usually a language that can be understood by our machines. A compiler take one pass through the code and try to understand what the code does_**. And it's going to take the program in JavaScript or any type of language and write a new program in your new language, let's say to programming language.

So _compiler tries to understand what we want to do and takes our language and changes it into something else and this usually happens into something called a lower level language, such as machine code_. Now, in some respects, all languages have to be interpreted and compiled because it has to run (it has to be interpreted) and it also has to most likely get translated into something low level like machine code.

But the main takeaways is this: **there are two ways to run JavaScript using an interpreter or a compiler**. Now, I know it's still a little bit fuzzy, but if I ask you, why would we want to do one over the other? What are the pros and cons on each? What do you think that is? Why would you pick one over the other?

**Babel + TypeScript**: Have you heard of Babel or TypeScript? They are heavily used in the Javascript ecosystem and you should now have a good idea of what they are: **Babel is a Javascript compiler that takes your modern JS code and returns browser compatible JS (older JS code). Typescript is a superset of Javascript that compiles down to Javascript. Both of these do exactly what compilers do: take one language and convert into a different one!**

Let's have a look at the pros and cons of each: First off, **interpreters are quick to get up and running**, right? Because if we want to run a Javascript code, with an interpreter we don't have to convert the code into another language, like language acts like I showed you with a compiler. There's no compilation step before you can start running your code, you just give the code to an interpreter and the interpreter starts translating their first line and just runs the code for us. Because of this, an interpreter is a natural fit for something like JavaScript and JavaScript originally was created for the browser, so being able to interpret JavaScript and run it as fast as possible. Well, that was ideal and this is exactly why it JavaScript used interpreters at the beginning, but there's a cons with using an interpreter. And this is the same problem that Google had back in the day when they had Google Maps running a lot of JavaScript, but it will get slower and slower and slower because **the problem with interpreters is that when you're running the same code more than once, for example, if you're in a loop where we're running a piece of code over and over and over, even though it gives us the same result, it can get really, really slow. The compiler actually helps us here. It takes a little bit more time to start up because it has to go through that compilation step at the beginning, go through our code, understand it and split it out into a another language. But the compiler will be smart enough that when it sees code like loop over a thing and the loop has the same inputs returning the same outputs, well, it can actually just simplify that code**.

**What if instead of using the compiler and interpreter, we combine these two and create something called a JIT compiler or Just In Time compiler? And this is exactly what browsers started doing, browser's started mixing compilers, specifically these JIT compilers for Just In Time compilation to make the engines faster**.

So is JavaScript an interpreted language? I mean, yes, initially when JavaScript first came out, you had JavaScript engines such as Spider Monkey that interpreted JavaScript to bytecode and that engine was able to run inside of our browsers to tell our computers what to do but things have evolved. _Now we don't have just interpreters, we also use compilers to optimize the code_. So this is a common misconception when somebody says JavaScript is an interpreted language. Yes, there is some truth to it but it actually depends on the implementation, you can make an implementation of JavaScript, of the JavaScript engine that perhaps only compiles.

We want to write **code that helps the compiler make its optimizations**, not work against it making the engine slower.

Why do we just learn all of this? Well, because now we know a critical part in being a JavaScript programmer, **we want to write code in a way that helps the compiler make optimizations**. We don't want to work against it and make things slow throughout the rest of the course. We're going to learn different ways to write efficient code. But I want to give you some basic things to watch out for when working with JavaScript Engine. Now, keep in mind that most of these things I'm going to show you will seem like things you don't really use or see that much anymore, and that's because most developers don't use them, since they can be bad for optimisations. But it never hurts to know what they are. It doesn't mean that you should never use them, but that the use cases for them are very rare. So here's the list: `eval()`, `arguments`, `for...in`, `with`, `detele`.

## Memoization

Memoization is a way to **cache a return value of a function based on its parameters**. This makes the function that takes a long time run much faster after one execution. If the parameter changes, it will still have to reevaluate the function.

```js
// Bad Way
function addTo80(n) {
  console.log('long time...')
  return n + 80
}
addTo80(5)
addTo80(5)
addTo80(5)
// long time... 85
// long time... 85
// long time... 85
// Memoized Way
functions memoizedAddTo80() {
  let cache = {}
  return function(n) { // closure to access cache obj
if (n in cache) {
      return cache[n]
    } else {
      console.log('long time...')
      cache[n] = n + 80
return cache[n]
    }
  }
}
const memoized = memoizedAddTo80()
console.log('1.', memoized(5))
console.log('2.', memoized(5))
console.log('3.', memoized(5))
console.log('4.', memoized(10))
// long time...
// 1. 85
// 2. 85
// 3. 85
// long time...
// 4. 90
```

## Memory Heap & Call Stack

The JavaScript engine does a lot of work for us, but 2 of the biggest jobs are reading and executing it. We need **a place to store and write our data** and **a place to keep track line by line of what's executing**. That's where the **Call Stack** and the **Memory Heap** come in.

The Memory Heap is **a place to store and write information** so that we can use our memory appropriately. It is **a place to allocate, use, and remove memory as needed**.

```js
// tell the memory heap to allocate memory for a number
const number = 11;

// allocate memory for a string
const string = 'some text';

// allocate memory for an object and it's values
const person = {
  first: 'Brittney',
  last: 'Postma',
};
```

The Call Stack **keeps track of where we are in the code, so we can run the program in order**. Things are placed into the Call Stack on top and removed as they are finished. It **runs in a first in last out mode. Each call stack can point to a location inside the Memory Heap**.

```js
function subtractTwo(num) {
  return num - 2;
}

function calculate() {
  const sumTotal = 4 + 5;
  return subtractTwo(sumTotal);
}

debugger;
calculate();
```

What is a program? Well, a program has to do some simple things. It has to **allocate memory**, otherwise we wouldn't be able to have variables or even have a file on our computer. It also has to **parse and execute scripts**, which means read and run commands.

The Javascript engine consists of two parts, a **Memory Heap** and a **Call Stack**. The **Memory Heap _is where the memory allocation happens_** and the **Call Stack _is where your code is read and executed_**, Call Stack tells you where you are in the program.

_We learned that the JavaScript engine does a lot of work for us, but the biggest thing is actually reading our code and executing it_. And what do you think the two most important things in this step are? That is, one, _we need a place to store and write information, that is to store our variables, our objects, our data of our apps and a place to actually run and keep track of what's happening line by line on our code_. Well, we use **Call Stack** and **Memory Heap** for that.

**We need the Memory Heap as a place to store and write information**, _because at the end of the day all programs are just read and write operations, that way we have a place to allocate memory, use memory and release memory_. And two, **with the Call Stack, we need a place to keep track of where we are in the code so that we can run the code in order**. And with these two things, the JavaScript engine is able to do that.

So to review the **Memory Heap _is where the memory allocation happens_** and the **Call Stack _is where the engine keeps track of where your code is in its execution_**.

**We can think of Call Stack as a region in memory which operates in first-in/last-out mode**.

_The Call Stack stores functions and variables as your code executes at each entry state of the stack, also called the stack frame and it runs in a first-in/last-out mode, that is the first one in is the last one getting popped up. And we can keep adding to the stack and eventually it pops, pops, pops all the function calls until we are done with our commands and we use the Memory Heap to actually point to different variables, objects and data that we store so that we know where to look. And by the way, this is the way it works in most programming languages, we have calls stacks and memory heaps and these are the two locations that JavaScript remembers._

_Now, since every JavaScript engine has different implementations, where variables are allocated is not 100% the same all the time. So a good way to think about it is this s**imple variables can usually be stored on the stack** and **data structures like objects, arrays and functions are stored in Memory Heap**_.

## Memory Leaks & Stack Overflow

**Memory leaks** happen when you have **unused memory**, such as variables that are declared globally but you don't use them, but they's still there. Well, _by having unused memory just laying around, it fills up the Memory Heap_ and that's why you might hear why global variables are bad. Global variables are bad because if we don't forget to clean up after ourselves, we fill up the Memory Heap and eventually the browser will not be able to work.

So what happens if you keep calling functions that are nested inside each other? When this happens it’s called a **stack overflow**. Example below:

```js
// When a function calls itself, it is called RECURSION
function inception() {
  inception();
}

inception(); // returns Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

_What stack overflow means? Well, stack overflow is this when a stack is overflowing, kind of like we talked about Memory Leaks and how the Memory Heap of a JavaScript engine can overflow. Well, with stack overflow, this happens when the Call Stack just gets bigger and bigger and bigger until it just doesn't have enough space anymore_.

_What happens if we keep calling functions nested inside of each other over and over and over so that we keep growing the Call Stack until it gets larger and larger and larger and larger and larger, until we can do it anymore? Well, that's called_ **stack overflow**.

**Recursion is a _function calling itself_**, there are some cases where things like recursion is quite useful, but that's something beyond the scope of this course and it's something I teach in my other courses for data structures and algorithms. But **recursion is one of the most common ways to create a stack overflow** or a lot of functions nested inside of each other to create that stack that keeps growing and growing and growing. In this case, if I run inception function, it's going to keep adding things onto the stack more and more and more. So what do you think happens if I run the inception function? I get an error like **Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded**. Now back in the day with Chrome, it wouldn't give you this error and the browser will eventually just crash, but in order to prevent the browser from crashing, if it reaches a limit, it's going to print out this error saying, hey, you've just created a stack overflow.

Let's create our own memory leak:

```js
const array = [];

for (let i = 5; i > 1, i++) {
    array.push(i-1);
}
```

Now, when I run this code above, what's going to happen is we're going to run an infinite loop and we fill up our memory and there's nothing left for us to use and well, we're going to crash the browser. Now, this was a silly example, and most likely you're not going to do in your programs, but there are **3 common memory leaks** that happened that I want to show you so you can avoid them in your application.

**The first one is global variables**. _If I just keep adding variables to my environment, well, we're adding more and more pieces of memory_.

**The second one is event listeners**. Now, _the event listeners is one of the most common ways to leak memory and that is you add an event listeners and you never remove them when you don't need them_, so that you keep adding, keep adding, keep adding event listeners and because they're just there in the background, you forget about them and next thing you know, you create a memory leak. This happens a lot, especially if you go back and forth between single page applications where you're not removing the event listeners off the page and as a user goes back and forth, back and forth, the memory keeps increasing more and more as more event listeners are added.

**The thirth one is setInterval()**. _This setInterval(), unless we clear it and stop it, is going to keep running and running and running_.

_Just something to be aware of that **memory is limited**. That is when it comes to Call Stack and Memory Heap. Those are two places that JavaScript remembers or stores memory and we have limited use of them_. So for us to write efficient code, we have to be conscious to not have stack overflow or a memory leak and to manage that memory well.

## Garbage Collection

JavaScript is a garbage collected language. If you allocate memory inside of a function, JavaScript will automatically remove it from the memory heap when the function is done being called.

JavaScript completes garbage collection with a **mark** and **sweep** method.

```js
var person = {
  first: 'Brittney',
  last: 'Postma',
};

person = 'Brittney Postma';
```

In the example above a **memory leak** is created. **By changing the variable person from an object to a string, it leaves the values of first and last in the memory heap and does not remove it**. This can be avoided by trying to keep variables out of the global namespace, only instantiate variables inside of functions when possible. JavaScript is **a single threaded language**, meaning only one thing can be executed at a time. It only has one call stack and therefore it is a **synchronous** language.

## Single Threaded Model

Each browser has its own version of **JavaScript Runtime** with a set of **Web API**'s, methods that developers can access from the **`window`** object. **In a synchronous language, only one thing can be done at a time**. Imagine an alert on the page, blocking the user from accessing any part of the page until the OK button is clicked. If everything in JavaScript that took a significant amount of time, blocked the browser, then we would have a pretty bad user experience. This is where **concurrency** and the **event loop** come in.
