# Default exports/imports in ES6 Modules

Use only **one default export per module**.

When you import a default export you can imported **without `{}`** and you can give **any name** that you want. We can give to default import any name that we want because **default export don't have a name**.

Default Export is designed to make it easy to have a default function provided by a module, and also helps JavaScript modules to _interoperate with existing **CommonJS** and **AMD module** systems_.
