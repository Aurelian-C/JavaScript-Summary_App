# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a **programming paradigm** fundamental to many programming languages, including Java and C++.

Object-Oriented Programming is about **modeling a system as a _collection of objects_, which each represent some particular aspect of the system**. _Objects contain both functions (or methods) and data_. An object provides a **public interface** to other code that wants to use it, but it maintains its own **private internal state**: this means that other parts of the system don't have to care about what is going on inside the object.

## Object-Oriented Programming characteristics

- We use objects to **model/describe** _real-world_ (E.g. user or todo list item) or _abstract features_ (E.g. HTML component or data structure);
- Objects may contain data (properties) and code (methods). By using objects, we
  **pack data and the corresponding behavior into one block**;
- In OOP, objects are **self-contained** pieces/blocks of code;
- Objects are **building blocks** of applications, and **interact** with one another;
- Interactions happen through a **public interface (API)**: methods that the code
  **outside** of the object can access and use to communicate with the object;
- OOP was developed with the goal of **organizing** code, to make it **more flexible**
  and **easier to maintain** (avoid “spaghetti code”).

## The 4 fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### Abstraction

_Ignoring or hiding details that **don’t matter**_, allowing us to get an **overview** perspective of the _thing_ we’re implementing, instead of messing with details that don’t really matter to our implementation.

### Encapsulation

Keeping properties and methods **private** inside the class, so they are **not accessible from outside the class**. Some methods can be **exposed** as a **public interface (API)**.

### Inheritance

Making all properties and methods of a certain class **available to a child class**, forming a hierarchical relationship between classes. This allows us to **reuse common logic** and to model real-world relationships.

### Polymorphism

A child class can **overwrite** a method it inherited from a parent class [it’s more complex that that, but enough for our purposes].
