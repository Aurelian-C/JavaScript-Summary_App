Some events, such as `click`, are available on nearly any element. Others are more specific and only useful in certain situations: for example, the [`play`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/play_event) event is only available on some elements, such as [`<video>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).
