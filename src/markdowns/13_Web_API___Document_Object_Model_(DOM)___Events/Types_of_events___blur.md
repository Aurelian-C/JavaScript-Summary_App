# Element: blur event

The **`blur`** event ==fires when an element has lost focus==. The main difference between this event and `focusout` is that `focusout` bubbles, while `blur` does not.

The opposite of `blur` is [`focus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/focus_event).

This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.

## Syntax

```js
addEventListener('blur', (event) => { });
```
