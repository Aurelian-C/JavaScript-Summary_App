# Intro to Loops

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something **repeatedly**. Loops can **execute a block of code a number of times**. Loops are handy, if you want to **run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value**. There are **many different kinds of loops**, but they all essentially do the same thing: they **repeat** an action some number of times. The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

## JavaScript supports **different kinds of loops**:

- **for** - loops through a block of code a number of times
- **for/of** - loops through the values of an _iterable object_
- **for/in** - loops through the _properties of an object_
- **while** - loops through a block of code _while a specified condition is true_
